- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time display of current settings via HUD overlay
- **Flexible Input**: Support for keyboard, standard game controllers, or specialized accessibility devices

### Educational Components
- **Telemetry Visualization**: Learn how vehicle parameters behave in real-time
- **Control Mapping**: Understand relationships between inputs and vehicle behavior
- **Data Analysis**: Study how adjustments affect vehicle dynamics
- **Configuration Management**: Experiment with different setup approaches

### Technical Features
- Real-time telemetry monitoring
- Customizable heads-up display (HUD)
- Per-car configuration storage

2. **Extract** the ZIP file to a location of your choice (e.g., `C:\DominantControl\`)
3. **Run** `DominantControl.exe`

**That's it!** No Python installation or dependencies required.

### Windows Security Note
Windows may show a security warning for unrecognized applications:
- Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
- This is normal for applications without expensive code-signing certificates

## Quick Start Guide

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Startup Order for Force Feedback**

To avoid force feedback issues:
1. **Start this application FIRST**
2. **Then start iRacing**
3. **After sim loads, scan controls**

Or simply enable **"Keyboard Only Mode"** in settings to eliminate this concern entirely.

### Setup Steps

1. **Launch iRacing** and enter a **private practice session**
2. **Run the application** (`iRacingControlManager.exe`)
3. **Enter CONFIG mode** by clicking the mode button
4. **Click "Scan Driver Controls"** to detect available vehicle adjustments
5. **Configure keys** for each control you need to access
6. **Set up presets** for quick access to specific values
7. **Switch to RUNNING mode** when ready
8. **Test thoroughly in private sessions** before any other use

**Important**: Always test in private, non-competitive sessions first.

## Basic Usage

### Configuration Mode
Use CONFIG mode to:
- Set up which controls you need access to
- Map keyboard keys or controller buttons to adjustments
- Create preset values for quick access
- Customize the HUD overlay
- Save configurations per car/track

### Running Mode
In RUNNING mode:
- The application monitors your vehicle telemetry
- Press your configured buttons to adjust controls
- HUD shows real-time values
- All adjustments happen through your configured inputs

## For Accessibility Users

If you have physical limitations that make reaching certain controls difficult:

1. **Identify which controls you cannot easily reach**
   - Brake bias adjustments
   - Traction control levels
   - Anti-roll bar adjustments
   - Other driver-adjustable settings

2. **Map them to accessible inputs**
   - Keyboard keys you can reach
   - Controller buttons in easy positions
   - Specialized accessibility devices

3. **Create presets for common values**
   - Quick access without multiple presses
   - Reduce physical strain

4. **Test in private sessions**
   - Ensure everything works for your needs
   - Adjust timings if needed

## For Educational Use

Students and learners can use this to:
- **Study telemetry**: See how vehicle parameters change in real-time
- **Understand relationships**: Learn how settings affect behavior
- **Experiment safely**: Test different configurations in private sessions
- **Analyze data**: Observe patterns in vehicle dynamics
- **Learn APIs**: Understand how racing sim telemetry systems work

## Configuration Management

The application stores all settings in:
```
%APPDATA%\DominantControl\configs\
```

This includes:
- Per-car control configurations
- Per-track presets
- HUD display preferences
- Input device mappings
- Timing profiles

Your configurations persist across updates and sessions.

## HUD Overlay

The customizable heads-up display shows:
- Current values of monitored controls
- Real-time updates
- Customizable colors, fonts, and opacity
- Draggable positioning
- Per-car variable selection

Configure what to display in the "HUD / Overlay" tab.

## Device Support

### Supported Input Devices
- Keyboard (always available)
- Game controllers / Joysticks
- Wheel button boxes
- Generic USB input devices

### Device Management
- Enable/disable specific devices
- Keyboard-only mode available
- Selective device permissions
- Accessible through the "Manage Devices" button

## Troubleshooting

### Force Feedback Issue

**Problem**: Force feedback stops working

**Cause**: Technical limitation of Python's joystick handling library when initialized after iRacing

**Solutions**:
1. **Prevention**: Always start the app BEFORE starting iRacing
2. **Quick fix**: Restart iRacing (app can stay open)
3. **Permanent solution**: Enable "Keyboard Only Mode" in settings (recommended if not using controller buttons)

See INSTALLATION.md and FAQ.md for detailed information.
