## Step 1: Download & Extract (30 seconds)

1. Download `DominantControl_v1.0.0.zip` from Releases
2. Extract to `C:\DominantControl\`
3. Done!

---

## Step 2: First Run - IMPORTANT ORDER! (30 seconds)

**⚠️ To avoid force feedback issues, follow this order:**

1. **FIRST**: Run `DominantControl.exe`
2. Windows warning? Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
3. **THEN**: Start iRacing

**Why?** Due to how input devices are initialized, opening the app after iRacing can cause force feedback loss. Opening the app first prevents this.

**Alternative:** Use "Keyboard Only Mode" (in settings) to completely avoid this issue.

## Quick Tips

### For Best Results
- ✅ Use in **private practice sessions**
- ✅ Test thoroughly before relying on it
- ✅ Save configurations for each car
- ✅ Create presets for your common values

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Forgetting to switch to RUNNING mode
- ❌ Not saving after configuration
- ❌ Using keys that conflict with iRacing
- ❌ Testing in public/competitive sessions

### Keyboard Key Suggestions
Good keys to use (typically don't conflict):
- **Numpad keys** (0-9, +, -, *, /)
- **F13-F24** (if your keyboard has them)
- **Ctrl+[key]** combinations
- **Alt+[key]** combinations

Avoid these (usually used by iRacing):
- F1-F12 (camera views, black box)
- Tab, Enter, Esc
- WASD, Arrow keys
- Space, Shift, Ctrl (without modifiers)

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### "Cannot connect to iRacing"
- Is iRacing running?
- Are you in a session (not menus)?
- Are you in the car (Drive mode)?
- → Restart both applications

### "Controls not working"
- Are you in RUNNING mode? (check top button)
- Did you save the configuration?
- Are the keys showing names (not "Set Increase")?
- → Switch to CONFIG, verify keys, save, switch back

### "HUD not visible"
- Options → Show/Hide Overlay
- Check if it's off-screen (try dragging)
- Verify opacity isn't too low
- → Go to HUD tab, check boxes, click Apply
